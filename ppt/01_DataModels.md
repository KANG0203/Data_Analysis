# Data Model
## Data type
1. Table - consist of records, attributes, relational database, transaction data
2. Vector, Matrix, Tensor - multi-dimensional  structure representing numerical data
3. Graph, Network - consist of nodes and edges, the web, social networks, molecular structures
4. Sequence of ordered data - Languages or textual data, dna sequences, click sequence in web commerce
5. Time-series - Sensor, stream data
6. Image and Multimedia - Pictures, videos
7. Spatial data - Map, spatiotemporal data

## Three components of Data model
1. Structures - rows & columns, nodes & edges, key-value pairs, a sequence of bytes
2. Constraints - all row must have the smae num of col, all values in one column must have the same type, a child cannot have two parents
3. Operations - ex> find the value of key x

## Relational database
table -> data -> database  
Every row in a table has the same columns.  
Row : record, tuple, instance, object, ...  
Column : attribute, field, feature, dimension, ...  

## Attribute type
1. Nomial(or Categorial) - Type of car, color name, ...
2. Binary - Gender, ...
3. Ordianl(순서) - Grade, ...
4. Numerical - Height, Temperature, ...
* Numverical could be 'Discrete' and 'Continuous'

## RDBMS (relational database management systems)
operation - manipulate tables by some algebraic structures allowing reasoning and manipulation independently of physical data representations
